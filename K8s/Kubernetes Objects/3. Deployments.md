## Deployments:

A [Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. It is a Kubernetes object that comes higher in the hierarchy. It provides us with the capability to update the underlying instances seamlessly using rolling updates, Android changes and pause & resume changes as required.

### Creating a Deployment:

- First, create a deployment definition file i.e the YAML file with the contents.
- It is the same as the `ReplicaSet` file where we replace the `kind` with `Deployment`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-deployment
  labels:
     app: my-app
     type: front-end

spec:
  template:

    metadata:
      name: myapp-pod
      labels:
        app: my-app
        type: front-end
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-container
        image: my-image:latest
replicas: 3
selector:
  matchLabels:
    type: front-end
```
- Once the file is created, execute `kubectl create -f file.yml` to create the deployment.
- To check if created or not, execute `kubectl get deployments`
- ReplicaSet is created in the name of the deployment, execute `kubectl get replicaset`, you will see ReplicaSet in the name of deployment.
- To see all the objects created at once, execute `kubectl get all`.
